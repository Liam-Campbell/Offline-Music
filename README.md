# Offline-Music

Hi this is a music application that i created as i wanted to use minimal CPU and RAM.
In addition i wanted to be able to listen completely offline hence my want to create this application.

How it works right now..

On first load it will go to a specified folder(found in properties of the project) and will fetch all songs in this folder
after they have been loaded you will have the ability to click play where a random song will start playing or you can select a 
song from the list.

Work in progress 
I am currently working on the ability to download songs off of youtube as MP3's into this folder(The goal is minimal network useage)
Please feel free to try it out and any advice or changes would be appericated.
